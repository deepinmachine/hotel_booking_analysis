# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data using Python and various data analysis libraries. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to gain insights into booking trends and patterns.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to leverage Python and data analysis tools to perform the following tasks:
- Clean and preprocess raw hotel booking data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Create interactive visualizations to effectively communicate findings.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Utilized Pandas to clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Standardized data formats and columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Investigated various aspects of the booking dataset.
   - Calculated summary statistics.
   - Identified trends in booking patterns such as peak booking times, popular locations, etc.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Created interactive plots and charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Visualized booking trends, guest demographics, and other relevant insights.
   - Ensured visualizations are clear, insightful, and suitable for presentation.

## Key Findings

- **Booking Trends:** Identified peak booking periods throughout the year.
- **Guest Demographics:** Analyzed guest profiles based on nationality, age, etc.
